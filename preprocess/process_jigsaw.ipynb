I have to shake my head when they suggest the paths the victims have to get something done about it. There is no path! You can file police reports which go into the que, snow removal or police protection, the latter is shut down in this town so there is one option. They go out of their way an send you to an online reporting system which goes into a round file. Our wonderful police department is under orders from Berkie to only respond when the body is cold, anything else gets the shovel....maybe. How many times do we read of someone doing something and they have a record as long as your arm yet they continue till they kill someone. I think there is a very good example the other day, guy kills his wife. Pretty sad when we are paying for both snow and police and get neither. However, we got three bathrooms.\n",
